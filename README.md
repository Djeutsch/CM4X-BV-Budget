# BV Budget Computing from GFDL CM4X


## Overview

In this task, the suite of the GFDL coupled model (CM), CM4X, is used. The GFDL CM4X simulations are used to compute and store the terms of the Barotropic Vorticity budget following the depth‐integrated Boussinesq‐hydrostatic ocean primitive equations.
